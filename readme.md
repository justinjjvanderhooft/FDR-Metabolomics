# Knockoff-based target-decoy approach to computesimilarities of metabolomic spectra and decoys usingSpec2Vec embeddings

Accurate  metabolite  identification  from  liquid  chromatogra-phy  tandem  mass  spectrometry  (LCâ€“MS/MS)  is  a  difficultproblem that has been addressed by a few studies.  The mostcommon technique consists of matching fragment spectra toreference library spectra.  To be able to assess the quality ofthese  matches,  the  contemporary  methods  use  target-decoyapproaches  that  are  compatible  with  the  commonly  used  co-sine similarity scores while keeping the False Discovery Rate(FDR) under control.  Recently, there has been an advance-ment  in  definition  of  spectral  similarity  which  introducedan unsupervised machine learning technique, Spec2Vec, thathas  proven  more  successful  in  identification  of  metabolites.This  paper  improves  the  existing  target-decoy  methods  andintroduces  a  new  Gaussian  knockoff-based  method  native  toSpec2Vec embeddings
