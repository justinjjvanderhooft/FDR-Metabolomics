## Guidance

* This file contains the time log for your project. It will be submitted along with your final dissertation.
* **YOU MUST KEEP THIS UP TO DATE AND UNDER VERSION CONTROL.**
* This timelog should be filled out honestly, regularly (daily) and accurately. It is for *your* benefit.
* Follow the structure provided, grouping time by weeks.  Quantise time to the half hour.

## Week 0

### 22 Sep 2020

* *2 hours* Familiarised myself with biology concepts necessary for understanding metabolomic problems mentioned by the supervisor
* *5 hours* Read the metabolomic papers provided by the supervisor and decided to pursue the FDR problem over LC/MS peak detection problem

## Week 1

### 29 Sep 2019

* *1 hour* Meeting with supervisor
* *2 hours* Wrote meeting minutes and created a plan for the upcoming weeks

### 1 Oct 2020

* *2 hour* Familirised myself with the concept of cosine similiraty score and Word2Vec approach
* *4 hours* Read the main FDR paper and created notes with all the concepts that are new 

### 2 Oct 2020

* *3 hours* Continued on understanding the FDR metabolomic paper and looked at other student's available repo that approaches two main methods
* *1 hour* Reorganised notes and created a GitHub repo with all the resources

## Week 2

### 5 Oct 2020

* *1.5 hours* Updated Conda environment, installed MatchMS

### 6 Oct 2020

* *2.5 hours* Installed Spec2Vec, Created a notebook with an example dataset, analysed the data, prepared questions for the meeting with supervisor
* *0.5 hour* Meeting with the supervisor, definining the plan for next week

### 7 Oct 2020

* *3 hours* More reading of FDR approaches in proteonomics, preparing to reproduce results from passatuto, downloaded the codebase and reorganised the data

### 8 Oct 2020

* *3 hours* Looked into the passatuto codebase, dived into other notebooks, prepared for parsing of passatuto data

### 9 Oct 2020

* *4 hours* Created a parser for passatuto data, emailed Justin and supervisor and decided to refine the approach for reproducing passatuto results

### 10 Oct 2020

* *1.5 hours* Read resources about mass spectrometry in metabolomics from Justin and Simon, talked to a mass spectrometry lecturer to clarify a few concepts

### 11 Oct 2020

* *1 hour* Read parts of the "Proteomics, lipidomics, metabolomics: a mass spectrometry tutorial from a computer scientist's point of view" by R. Smith et al

## Week 3

### 12 Oct 2020

* *1 hour* Went through the Github Gist tutorial on Word2Vec from Allison Parrish.

### 13 Oct 2020

* *3 hours* Organised papers in a new reference manager, made notes for "Proteomics, lipidomics, metabolomics: a mass spectrometry tutorial from a computer scientist's point of view" by R. Smith et al
