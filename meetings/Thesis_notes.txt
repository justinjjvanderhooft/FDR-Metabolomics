- clear the code (remove unnecessary default parameters from preprocessing)
- can we get rid of the preprocessing of decoys?
- why do i need such a high allowed missing percentage for decoys?
- create graphs and three notebooks (lc-ms, passatutto, passatutto basic, gcms)
- create bibliography
- create graphs
- notebook for dimensionality exp. (copy the graphs)
- notebook for training of the model
- make sure to check the accuracy level of creating SpectrumDocuments. Do we need two decimal points or one?



you can add tree frag from Passatutto to the graphs

try binning decimals 1 for everything
