Notes during the meeting:
Contact Florian in case you need help in training models with different dimensions or contact Simon for access to his Linux machine in the office.

GC/MS FDR estimation should only happen once I have the entire working pipeline for FDR in LC/MS

Until next week:
Try to ran the Spec2Vec dimensionality optimization experiments and present results to Simon. Run the knockooff notebook with the most optimal dimensions.
