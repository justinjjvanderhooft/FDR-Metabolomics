Notes before the meeting:

How many knockoffs do we want to generate from a single spectrum. In this scenario do we generate one instead od 50?
Do we need the second randomisation step if we produce only one knockoff?

Discuss dimensionality and what else do we need in the pipeline?


Notes during the meeting:

We want to generate a single knock off.

Fit a gaussian mixture, get sigma and mu (there will be k gaussians for k vectors)

Take a corresponding Gaussian to generate knockoffs.

No need to know how to optimize D further just yet,

Look for the notebook that Florian has done with red curve, black curve ( comparison of spec2vec to cosine), amount of true positives.
This notebook will help you in defining demensions.
