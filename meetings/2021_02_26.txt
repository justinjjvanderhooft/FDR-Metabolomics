What's next:
- make the analysis on Passatutto data and embed their decoys to compare them appropriately with the knockoffs.
- write to Justin and Florian about GC/MS trained model and progress (cc Simon).
- continue writing thesis but Simon will only want to read it once before submission so make sure you give him enough time.
