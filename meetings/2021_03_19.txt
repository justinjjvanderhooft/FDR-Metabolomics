Remember to not go into detail regarding metaboomics, it's better to do a paragraph from a computer scientist point of view (what are spectra? A list of tuples with mass)

Don't cover too many knockoff techniques, focus on why we chose this specific one and why it works with spectra (given Spec2Vec).
