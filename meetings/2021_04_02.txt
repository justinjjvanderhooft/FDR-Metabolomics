vast majority of the metabolite that exist, we don't have a structure.

Talk more about FDR,challenges-spectral databases are small, even when comparing to a database we have no idea.

Introduction:
State the problem, the main process and key challenges, talk more about knockoffs.

Aim
Summarise the problems that are mention in the introduction.


Simon's comments on the draft

Before describing the sections, talk about data, what a spectrum is, don't care about preprocessing, describe query, define target, section about what the data is

Section 2.2 should be: Metbaolite identification instead
Talk about query-database and definiton of a hit, only then talk about Cosine.


You can use QR codes for spectra, Simon likes them ;)


Talk more about other methods than Passatutto

In the FDR section what is a type one error when we talk about spectra --> we get a hit that's an incorrect hit for our query

In references refer to the paper not to the tool itself.

Given two vectors and knockoffs (fix the first part) of the knockoff section.

With Scheubert state you use their dataset in 5.1.

Figure 1. 75 dimensions for Spec2Vec.

Figure 2. Mention recreation (swich empochs to iteration or the other wayaround).

Figure 3. Put lines from figure 2 and 3 together and why 3 is better.

Figure 4. Write more in a caption.

Users are going to accept hits that are of FDR < 5% score threshold.

Find a score theshold that keeps you at 5 % FDR, what range do I get to.

Run 10 times, variability of the FDR threshohold.


Figure 6 fix the caption and add the cummulative number of spectra or add a separate histogram.
