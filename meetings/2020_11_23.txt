Notes before the meeting:
For the decoys, we do not have parent mass to compare to but we have precurser_mz. Can we caclculate cosine similarity comparing query parent_mass and precursor_mz from decoys?

Notes during the meeting:

take database, embed
take query, embed
compute similarity

take pretrained spec2vec model
take their target data -> embed it
same for decoy
