Notes during the meeting and plan for next week:

parent mass differs by certain amount
precursor_amass _ms in gnps
parent_mass in massbankorbi
search through two daltons or one dalton, just print and see what happens
use rdkit to compute exact mass
if you find anything that has a charge more than one, contact Simon
