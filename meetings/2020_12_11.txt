Notes before the meeting:
Are there any statistical resources to understand knockoffs better?
Status report and a few questions on the plan for the project.

Notes during the meeting:

Define 2 dimentional Gaussian with mean and covariance, take the formula from the knockoff paper
Plot where the knockoff is coming from and when the actual vector is coming from.

When definiting the most optimal dimensions for Spec2Vec, plot true positives false positives, how the plot differes.
