1. Can Justin help read the thesis?
2. What other test statistics could we use to measure success?
3. What should be the structure of the methods section?
4. How much of GC/MS should we include?

There is no other test statistics that I need to include, q-value plots are just fine.
Justin can read my work but he will most likely help around biology.
Send the thesis on Thursday so that Simon can give me feedback by next Friday.
Methods can be structured the same way as they are right now.
Simon would include GC/MS and why it did not work out.
