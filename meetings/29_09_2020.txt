The meeting was held for about an hour and was treated as an introduction to the problem. The meetings involved:

	- discussion of the FRD paper (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01318-5) and current approaches
	- touching on the general scope of the project
	- exposure to all the tools necessary for peak comparisons in MS data 

Two questions that need to be answered while working on this project:
	- can we do better target-decoy FDR if we can compare similarities in embedded space but not in real spectra
A follow up questions:
	- can we then be statistically smarter in how we compute decoys because of the much smarter space?

Knock offs:
We need to be able to show if we can generate decoys in the embedded space.

Actions to take:
Play with the data and explore Spec2Vec and MatchMS. Try to do a comparison of the first two methods present in the paper. Start with MatchMS codebase to be able to make the plots from the paper using LC/MS data.
