Notes before the meeting:
- Where can I get Agilent data, should I care about it?
- Why do we obtain cosine similarity score equal to 0 where the compounds are the same?
- For the MassBank data there are multiple collisions per file. How do we interpret it?

final outcome: find if it's a true or false hit:

1. take the query name from the file with cosine scores and the inchi key of the target
2. by looking at the query name in the query file, compare the inchi key of the query to the target from step 1
3. if inchi key is the same then it's a true hit, otherwise it's not

1.1 cut the target inchi key in a way that it has only digits and letters until first "/"
2.1 do the same as step 1.1 for the inchi in the query

Notes during the meeting:

Cosine ismiliraty can be equal to 0 when the compounds are the same, it's a matter of having noisy data and broken mass specs.
Mulitple collisions per file are merged all together in MatchMS.

Plan for next week:

compare using inchi keys using an exteranl library https://www.rdkit.org/docs/source/rdkit.Chem.html
