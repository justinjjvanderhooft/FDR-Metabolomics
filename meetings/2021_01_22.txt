Notes during the meeting:

Do not try to plot q-value plots with dimensions and knockoffs. Try to optimise the dimensions first, based on Florians notebook with true/false positives.

Later, we will want to experiment with D and number of mixture components in the knockoff creation but only when we find the most optimal dimensions.

Plan for next week:

Send the true/false positive rate plots to Simon for different dimensions and choose the most optimal one. Then move on to experimenting with D and number of mixture

components.
