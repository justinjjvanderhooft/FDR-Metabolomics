# Plan

* PROJECT TITLE: (to be finalised) FDR target-decoy approach to compute similarieties of real metabolomic spectra and decoys using the Spec2Vec embeddings.
* NAME: Malgorzata Kurkiewicz
* STUDENT_ID: 2145411k
* SUPERVISOR NAME: Simon Rogers

Week-by-week plan for the whole project. Update this as you go along.

## Winter semester

* **Week 1** Set up a GitHub repo, read scientific literature provided by the supervisor
* **Week 2** Play with the data sets given using Spec2Vec and MatchMS, understand the outcome of the work and draw it, prepare to write an introduction/literature review
* **Week 3** Create the literature review, organise your knowledge
* **Week 4** Recreate two methods from the Scheubert et al. and play with the Knockoff FDR method
* **Week 5** Recreate two methods from the Scheubert et al. and play with the Knockoff FDR method
* **Week 6** Recreate two methods from the Scheubert et al.
* **Week 7** Create a general pipeline for calculating q-values given mass spec query and target data
* **Week 8** Create a general pipeline for calculating q-values given mass spec query and target data
* **Week 9** Train Spec2Vec Model and incorporate it inside the current pipeline.
* **Week 10** Train Spec2Vec Model and incorporate it inside the current pipeline.
* **Week 11 [PROJECT WEEK]** Incorporate the Knockoffs into the current pipeline
* **Week 12 [PROJECT WEEK]** Status report submitted.

## Winter break

## Spring Semester

* **Week 13** Continue experimenting with the knockoff technique, experiment with Spec2Vec dimensionality to find the most optimal parameters.
* **Week 14** Continue experimenting with the knockoff technique and evaluate the current results, progresson the background for the thesis.
* **Week 15** Adjust the pipeline to account for GC/MS data, progress on the introduction for the thesis.
* **Week 16** Progress on including GC/MS data, progress on the experimental part of the thesis.
* **Week 17** Progress on including GC/MS data, progress on the experimental part of the thesis.
* **Week 19** Test the FDR estimation pipeline with different set of data inputs (LC/MS, GC/MS, libraries,denoised data sets etc.), progress on the experimental part of the thesis.
* **Week 20** Continue testing the pipeline, refactor code and write documentation.
* **Week 21** Evaluate all results and progress in writing evaluation for the thesis.
* **Week 22** Write the conclusion for the thesis,  discuss handover of the project and talk to interestedparties that could benefit from knowing about these results.
* **Week 23 [TERM ENDS]** Create a presentation on the project.
* **Week 24** Dissertation submission deadline and presentations.
